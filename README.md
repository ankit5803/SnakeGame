# Hand Gesture-Controlled Snake Game

A modern twist on the classic Snake game â€” control the snake **using your hand gestures** via your webcam!  
Built with **MediaPipe** (for hand tracking), **KNN classifier** (for gesture recognition), and **PyGame** (for the game).

---

## Features
- Control Snake using **4 hand gestures** (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
- **Live score display** during gameplay.
- **Restart or Quit** after Game Over (`R` to restart, `Q` to quit).
- Optimized for **low-end hardware** (fast webcam initialization and reduced lag).
